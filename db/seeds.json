        "paragraph1": "Physically, the original iteration of this game is designed as a compact object that can be easily managed whilst in the act of shifting hands while reaching for buttons. A virtual iteration delegates the 'handling' of the object to the mobile device or the pointing control (ie: a phone or a mouse), thus revealing a larger gamut of possibilities for its visual representation.",
